## E.Datacenter.8:

Find major data center outages and discuss the concrete impact on the internet and user community. Concrete means here not users of the center xyz lost services, but can you identify how many users or how many services were impacted and which? Is there a cost revenue loss projected somewhere? If you find an outage, do significant research on it. For example, other metrics could include what media impact did this outage have?
